# Object Classification
A year 2 coding project on image classification
## About
This repository stores files related to my Year Two project about implementing convolutional neural network with Keras. With an object-oriented approach, a classifier which can be reused on different datasets was built, enhancing modularity and reusability.
## Note
* When uploading image, please upload in JPG format as PNG has more channels, thus creating errors.
* Labels are one-hot encoded for better performance
